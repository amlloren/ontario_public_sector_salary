# Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure
Data Science Institute - Cohort 4 - Data Visualization: Final Project

As part of my Final Project for the Visualization module of the Data Science Software Foundations certificate I created data visualizations for the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure between 1996 and 2023. To start I explored static data visualization using Python for 5 years of the dataset. Next, I explored creating dynamic plots using Tableau Public. Lastly, I expanded this project into a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard (in-progress).

## Data Visualization: Final Project

### Dataset of Choice:
* Link to datasets: https://www.ontario.ca/page/public-sector-salary-disclosure
* This dataset was used to create data visualizations for the Average Salary by Sector based on the Ontario Public Sector Salary Discloure.
* NOTE: I downloaded individual datasets for the years 1996 to 2023, since the file sizes for these were larger that 100 MB they are not included in my repo. 

### Navigating my Final Project submission:

1. Data Visualization using Python
    * Goal: Create data visualizations the Average Salary by Sector based on the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure for the years 2019 to 2023 (5 Years).
    * Supporting Files:
        * [1_python_viz.md](ontario_public_sector_salary/1_python_viz.md) - contains my answers to the describe and justify questions.
        * [2_python_visualization_1.ipynb](ontario_public_sector_salary/2_python_visualization_1.ipynb) - contains the python code I used to create the data visualization
        * [python_viz_output](ontario_public_sector_salary/python_viz_output) folder.

2. Data Visualization using Tableau Public
    * Goal: Create robust data visualizations of the Average Salary by Sector based on the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure for the years 1996 to 2023 (28 years). 
    * Supporting Files:
        * [3_tableau_viz.md](ontario_public_sector_salary/3_tableau_viz.md) (contains my answers to the describe and justify questions)
        * [4_data_cleaning_for_tableau.ipynb](ontario_public_sector_salary/4_data_cleaning_for_tableau.ipynb)
        * Link to Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adrienne.lloren/viz/shared/7QQDTS66C


## Final Project Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontario’s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words**
